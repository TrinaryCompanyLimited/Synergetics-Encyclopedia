Synergetics is the system of holistic thinking which R. Buckminster Fuller introduced and began to formulate.
Synergetics is multi-faceted: it involves geometric modeling, exploring inter-relationships in the facts of experience
and the process of thinking. Synergetics endeavors to identify and understand the methods that Nature actually uses in 
coordinating Universe (both physically and metaphysically).Synergetics provides a method and a philosophy for problem-solving
and design and therefore has applications in all areas of human endeavor.
